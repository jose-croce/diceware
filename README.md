# diceware

This program is a fun way to learn how to build executables in Go!

It generates strong passphrases using the Diceware algorithm, a method that
relies on rolling dice to select random words from a word list.

[The Diceware Passphrase Home Page](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).

> **Disclaimer:**
>
> The Diceware method explicitly discourages the use of software-based random
> number generators.
> This implementation, however, utilizes the random number generator provided
> by the Go crypto package, which is a widely-accepted source of
> cryptographic-grade randomness.
> While this approach offers a reasonable level of security, it's important to
> recognize that physical dice remain the most secure method for Diceware
> passphrase generation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To generate a new passphrase, simply run the diceware executable. It will print the passphrase to your terminal.

### Additional Options

You can customize your passphrase generation with the following options:

- **available-languages**:
  List all supported languages and exit.
- **digits**:
  Force the inclusion of digits in the passphrase.
- **lang _value_**:
  Specify the language to use for word selection.
- **length _value_**:
  Set the desired number of words in the passphrase.
- **lower**:
  Force all words to be lowercase.
- **symbols**:
  Add delimiting symbols between words.
- **upper**:
  Force all words to be uppercase.

By default, the passphrase will be in Pascal case
(first letter of each word capitalized)
and may include digits without delimiters.
